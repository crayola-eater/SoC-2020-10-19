/* 
Write a function that takes ANY number of objects and returns ONE object which contains totals for all encountered keys and values.

So, for example, if we handed the function the objects below:

    {a: 1, b: 2},
    {a: 2, b: 7, c: 3},
    {a: 5, c: 3}

we'd expect back:

  {a: 8, b: 9, c: 6}

Remember that each object in the array may (or may not) have the same properties (as the other objects).
The object will not have any nested objects as values (so you don't have to worry about arbitrarily deep/nested objects).
You can assume that your function will only receive objects (so you don't need to write guards/checks for non-objects).

function addObjects(...objects) {
  // Write your code here, good luck, thanks!
}

module.exports = {
  addObjects,
};
